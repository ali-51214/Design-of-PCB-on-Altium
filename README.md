# Design-of-PCB-on-Altium
This project represents my final year project, where I designed and built a two-layer PCB using Altium Designer. The PCB integrates a variety of components, including sensors, actuators, headers, and a microcontroller. The design's primary goal was to create a compact yet functional PCB that could be used for various embedded systems applications.

## Project Overview
The design process involved creating a schematic, laying out the PCB, and then manufacturing and testing the board. Here's a brief summary of the key components and their roles:

- **Microcontroller**: This is the central processing unit for the PCB, responsible for controlling the sensors and actuators. I used AVR MicroController in this case
- **Sensors**: The project used various sensors to detect environmental changes and inputs. As my project was realted to detecting Health parameter, So i used 4 different sensors.
- Including Temp, BPM, ECG, MaX300100
- **Actuators**: Actuators were included to demonstrate the output capabilities of the system.
- **Headers**: Multiple headers were added to allow for easy connection to other components and peripherals.

## Design Process
Using Altium Designer, I completed the following steps to create the two-layer PCB:

1. **Schematic Design**: I created a schematic that outlined the connections between the components.
2. **PCB Layout**: The two-layer PCB was designed to optimize space and ensure proper signal routing.
3. **Manufacturing and Assembly**: After designing, I sent the PCB layout to a manufacturer, and then assembled the board with the appropriate components.
4. **Testing and Debugging**: After assembly, I tested the board to ensure functionality and debugged any issues that arose.

## Challenges and Solutions
During the project, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **Signal Integrity**: Managing signal integrity with a compact two-layer PCB was a key challenge. I addressed this by carefully planning the PCB layout and using appropriate design rules.
- **Component Placement**: Optimizing component placement to minimize interference and maximize functionality.
- **Microcontroller Firmware**: Writing and debugging the firmware to ensure the proper operation of sensors, actuators, and other components.

## Outcomes
The final result was a fully functional two-layer PCB that met the project's objectives. The board demonstrated a successful integration of sensors, actuators, headers, and a microcontroller, providing a versatile platform for embedded systems applications.

## Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to:
- Explore additional sensors and actuators to expand the PCB's capabilities.
- Optimize the PCB design for better signal integrity and reduced interference.
- Develop more complex firmware to add advanced features and improve system performance.
